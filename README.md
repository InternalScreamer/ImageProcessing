# Image Processing C++ Library #
## Introduction
### This library is a place for me to try to practice and develop my understanding of object oriented design and C++. This readme will start out as a todo list and eventually evolve into actual documentation about the repository. I want to implement best practices in DevOps as well and truth be told I dont entirely know what that entails but as my knowledge grows the less this public repo will make people cringe. 

## Todo #1
### Plan out the structure of the initial image processing design. As the repository matures and more functionality is added the structure will change. 

## Todo #2
### Add a build script most likely in Cmake. To learn good build practices and make this repo Cross Platform.

## Todo #3
### Implement a testing platform such as google tests. (This will require a lot of discpline haha)

Note: As the repository grows so will the todo list (Documentation, pipeline, diagnostics) I also really hope I dont abandon this repo and leave it to the github code graveyard.
