# Image Format Implementation
## Plan: Python Implementation
Currently the plan is to use python numpy/scipy libraries to deal with the different image formats (jpeg and PNG). I want to leverage the functionality of these python libraries in order to handle all of the complex decoding and decompression of these images. Ultimately I want the core data (eg. RGB values and size). I will port the data into a file format that contains these information and is easily parsable.

## Future Plans:
I do want to eventually learn how to parse these image types myself in order to gain a better understanding and to improve the dataflow, but for now I feel it will take to long to implement that functionality.
